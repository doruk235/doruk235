Hey, I’m Doruk!
I’m a student at Hanze studying CMGT. I mostly make games, but I do general programming too. I mostly work with C# and Java, but I have used others from JavaScript to Assembly. While I’m primarily a programmer, I also do game design and music composition.

I mostly work on Game Systems Design/Development. I excel at working with designers to create design requirements for systems, and coming up with creative, easy to use, and scalable solutions.

You can find all of my finished games on [itch.io](https://doruk2.itch.io/)

You can find my music on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-859288814)
